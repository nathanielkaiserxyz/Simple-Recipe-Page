<a href='index.php?l=Home'><h2>A simple recipe page :D</h2></a>
<hr />
<h3>What is this site?????</h3>
<p>This is simply a simple page for recipes, click on the links under navigation.</p>
<p>This is basically just a school assignment that got out of hand.</p>
<h3>Why is this page good??????</h3>
<p>Most recipe sites are extremely bloated and you have to scroll through 15 paragraphs just to get to the actual recipe. Fortunately, this does not apply to Simple Recipe Page.</p>
